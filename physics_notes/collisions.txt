PHYSICS COLLISIONS
  Elastic Collisions:
    - objects involved remain seperate
    - total kinetic energy and momentum will be conserved 
    - no energy lost
    - Momentum is a vector quantity 
      - mass * vel 
    - Kinetic Energy 
      - energy an object possess by virtue of its motion 
      - ke = (1/2)mv^2    


  Inelastic Collision: 
    - two seperate objects collide and move as one mass
